# TurtleScript
TurtleScript is a scripting language I made to control Python's turtle module


Here's an example
```
# simple script that draws a square

# create a new turtle named 'Tyler'
new turtle Tyler


# draw a square with Tyler

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90
```

## TODO:
* [x] Add loops
* [ ] Add a loop index variable to loops
* [ ] Add file importing(`use "[file path]"` will run the given file)
* [ ] Add functions
* [ ] Add if statements(maybe)

<br>

**If you get a `turtle.Terminator` error, just restart the interpreter, I'm still working on fixing that**

<br>

Btw your turtle names should start with T<br>
(or you can just use any human name, you should only use stuff like x, y, z, etc in testint)

here's a list of names that start with T I found:<br>

(it has a somewhat high amount of ads, sorry)
