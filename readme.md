# TurtleScript
TurtleScript is a scripting language I made that let's you control the Python turtle module with a coding language specifically made for it


Here's an example
```
# simple script that draws a square

# create a new turtle named 't'
new turtle t


# move the turtle

t forward 100

t left 90

t forward 100

t left 90

t forward 100

t left 90

t forward 100

t left 90
```
