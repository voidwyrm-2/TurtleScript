# TurtleScript
TurtleScript is a scripting language I made to control Python's turtle module


Here's an example
```
# simple script that draws a square

# create a new turtle named 'Tyler'
new turtle Tyler


# draw a square with Tyler

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90

Tyler forward 100

Tyler left 90
```

## TODO:
* [x] Add loops
* [ ] Add if statements(maybe)

<br>

Btw your turtle names should start with T

here's a list of names that start with T I found:<br>
